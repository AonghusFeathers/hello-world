Age Calculator

This program takes two inputs - the user's name, and the year the user was born. The program takes the current year and subtracts the year the user entered from it in order to gather an estimate of how old the user is. Finally, the program will take the age it gathered and put it into a print statement along with the user's name, stating their name and age.
